# Itsy-bitsy-autograd

Itsy-bitsy-autograd is a minimalistic automatic differntiation engine implemented in Python. It facilitates the computation of gradients for scalar-valued functions (Values) through DAGs, enabling the training of simple neural networks through backpropagation.

- Compute gradients of scalar functions with respect to inputs using reverse-mode autodiff.

This simple project is based on Micrograd by Andrej Karpathy.
