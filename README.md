# Itsy-bitsy-autograd

Itsy-bitsy-autograd is a minimalistic automatic differntiation engine implemented in Python. It facilitates the computation of gradients for scalar-valued functions (Values) through DAGs, enabling the training of simple neural networks through backpropagation.

### Features

- Automatic Differentiation: Compute gradients of scalar functions with respect to inputs using reverse-mode autodiff.
- Dynamic Computation Graphs: Build computation graphs dynamically, allowing for flexible model architectures.

This simple project is inspired by Micrograd by Andrej Karpathy.
